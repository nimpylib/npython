] ##[ `_PyLong_DigitValue`

Table of digit values for 8-bit string -> integer conversion.
'0' maps to 0, ..., '9' maps to 9.
'a' and 'A' map to 10, ..., 'z' and 'Z' map to 35.
All other indices map to 37.
Note that when converting a base B string, a char c is a legitimate
base B digit iff PyLong_DigitValue[c] < B.
